# •Excited to share my latest Data Analysis project!

## • Objective: To contribute to the success of a business by utilizing data analysis techniques, specifically focusing on time series analysis, to provide valuable insights and accurate sales forecasting.

### • Here's how I approached the project:

1. Dashboard Creation: Identified the KPIs, designed an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard, and added interactive visualizations and filtering capabilities to allow users to explore the data at various levels of granularity.

2. Data Analysis: Provided valuable insights to business entities regarding the effectiveness of their sales strategies through visualization and charts.

3. Sales Forecasting: Leveraged historic data and applied time series analysis to generate sales forecasts for the next 15 days.

4. Actionable Insights and Recommendations: The end goal was to share valuable insights and actionable information that can drive strategic decision-making and support the supermarket's goals for growth, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

• Tools used: Power BI for data visualization, making it easier to understand and act on the data.

This project is a perfect example of how data analysis can be used to drive business success by providing a clear picture of past performance and predicting future trends.
